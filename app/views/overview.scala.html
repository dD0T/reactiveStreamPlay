        <h1>Hi there</h1>
        <p>This is the overview page for the Reactive Stream Play (RSP) playground.
            This project explores various different ways of using reactive programming techniques in Scala.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>The application takes in messages from a streaming source like twitter and passes them into a
        user configurable transformation pipeline. The messages can be filtered and transformed in a number
        of ways. Configuration as well as the display of the result happens interactively through this
        website.</p>


    <p>Techniques used are:
        <ul>
            <li>Akka actors</li>
            <li>Play iterators</li>
            <li>Scala-RX observers (FRP)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
